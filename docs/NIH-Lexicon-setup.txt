Instructions for setting up the NIH Lexicon

Download and unpack the latest version of lexAccess from
http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/SPECIALIST/Projects/lexAccess/current/

The "lite" version is fine, you don't need the full version

The actual DB is in data\HSqlDb  directory . You must specify the
directory filename/path in the NIHDBLexicon constructor.  Eg

	static String DB_FILENAME = "E:\\NIHDB\\lexAccess2009\\data\\HSqlDb";
	Lexicon lexicon = new NIHDBLexicon(DB_FILENAME);
	

You can get the latest version of the lexAccess jar file (which may contain
updates to the jar file in the simplenlg release) from
lib/lexAccess2009dist.jar

Simplenlg also needs the lexCheck jar file, you can get the latest version
(which may contain updates to the jar file in the simplenlg release) from
http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/SPECIALIST/Projects/lexCheck/current

WARNING: use the lexAccess version of the DB, do **NOT** use the main
version in http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/SPECIALIST/Projects/lexicon/current
